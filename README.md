# Application of AutoGluon to foundry data
This project was prepared as part of the research workshop in winter semester 2023/2024. The task was to deploy two machine learning models to predict two chosen variables from a dataset describing the properties of cast iron samples. The chosen variables were:
* Charpy impact strength [J]
* Rm [MPa]
